# Ported Routes Summary

This document summarizes the routes that have been ported from the provided SDK-based conversation router to the existing local conversation system.

## Ported Routes

The following routes have been successfully ported and integrated into the existing local conversation system:

### 1. Send Message to Conversation
- **Route**: `POST /local-conversations/{id}/messages`
- **Description**: Send a message to a conversation and optionally run it
- **Request Body**: `SendMessageRequest`
- **Response**: `Success`

### 2. Run Conversation
- **Route**: `POST /local-conversations/{id}/run`
- **Description**: Start or resume the agent run for a conversation
- **Response**: `Success`

### 3. Respond to Confirmation
- **Route**: `POST /local-conversations/{id}/respond_to_confirmation`
- **Description**: Accept or reject a pending action in confirmation mode
- **Request Body**: `ConfirmationResponseRequest`
- **Response**: `Success`

## Already Existing Routes (Mapped)

These routes from the original code already existed in the local conversation system:

1. **Start Conversation**: `POST /local-conversations/` (was `POST /conversations/`)
2. **List Conversations**: `GET /local-conversations/search` (was `GET /conversations/`)
3. **Get Conversation State**: `GET /local-conversations/{id}` (was `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}`)
4. **Get Events**: `GET /local-conversations/{conversation_id}/events/search` (was `GET /conversations/{conversation_id}/events`)
5. **Pause Conversation**: `POST /local-conversations/{id}/pause` (was `POST /conversations/{conversation_id}/pause`)
6. **Close Conversation**: `DELETE /local-conversations/{id}` (was `DELETE /conversations/{conversation_id}`)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Service Layer Updates
- Added new abstract methods to `LocalConversationService`:
  - `send_message_to_conversation()`
  - `run_conversation()`
  - `respond_to_confirmation()`

### 2. Default Service Implementation
- Implemented the new methods in `DefaultLocalConversationService`
- Fixed agent creation logic to properly instantiate agents from stored configuration
- Added proper tool creation from `ToolSpec` objects
- Added MCP tools support
- Fixed event listener implementation

### 3. Event Context Improvements
- Fixed import issues with `ConversationStatus` â†’ `AgentExecutionStatus`
- Added proper agent and conversation initialization
- Added `search()` method alias for compatibility
- Fixed working directory type annotation

### 4. Model Updates
- All required models (`SendMessageRequest`, `ConfirmationResponseRequest`, etc.) were already present
- No additional model changes were needed

## Architecture Differences

The ported implementation follows the existing architectural patterns:

1. **Service Layer**: Uses the established service abstraction pattern instead of direct in-memory storage
2. **Async Operations**: Uses asyncio tasks instead of FastAPI BackgroundTasks
3. **Event Handling**: Integrates with the existing pub/sub event system
4. **Persistence**: Uses the file-based persistence system instead of in-memory storage
5. **Error Handling**: Follows the established error handling patterns with proper HTTP status codes

## Usage Examples

### Send a Message and Run
```bash
POST /local-conversations/{id}/messages
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, please help me with this task"}],
  "run": true
}
```

### Run a Conversation
```bash
POST /local-conversations/{id}/run
```

### Respond to Confirmation
```bash
POST /local-conversations/{id}/respond_to_confirmation
{
  "accept": true,
  "reason": "User approved the action"
}
```

## Notes

1. The confirmation response logic is partially implemented - full confirmation handling would require additional SDK support
2. All routes maintain backward compatibility with the existing API structure
3. The implementation preserves the existing authentication and authorization patterns
4. Error handling follows the established patterns with appropriate HTTP status codes
