# Webhook Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the unimplemented methods in the `_WebhookSubscriber` class to enable webhook functionality for posting events to external endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `_WebhookSubscriber` Class
**File:** `openhands_server/sdk_server/conversation_service.py`

- **Added session_api_key parameter**: The class now accepts an optional `session_api_key` parameter
- **Implemented `__call__` method**: Adds events to a queue and posts to webhook when buffer size is reached
- **Implemented `close` method**: Posts any remaining events in the queue when the subscriber is closed
- **Added `_post_events` method**: Handles the actual HTTP posting with retry logic

### 2. Enhanced ConversationService
**File:** `openhands_server/sdk_server/conversation_service.py`

- **Added session_api_key field**: ConversationService now stores the session API key
- **Updated webhook subscriber creation**: Passes session_api_key to webhook subscribers
- **Updated get_instance method**: Properly initializes webhook_specs and session_api_key from config

### 3. Fixed PubSub Close Method
**File:** `openhands_server/sdk_server/pub_sub.py`

- **Fixed infinite recursion**: Removed the recursive call in the `close()` method
- **Added proper cleanup**: Clears the subscribers dictionary after closing all subscribers

### 4. Enhanced EventService
**File:** `openhands_server/sdk_server/event_service.py`

- **Added PubSub cleanup**: EventService now calls `close()` on the PubSub when closing

### 5. Updated Inheritance
**File:** `openhands_server/sdk_server/conversation_service.py`

- **Made subscribers inherit from Subscriber**: Both `_EventSubscriber` and `_WebhookSubscriber` now properly inherit from the `Subscriber` base class

## Key Features Implemented

### HTTP Requests with httpx
- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` for making HTTP requests
- Supports configurable HTTP methods (defaults to POST)
- Includes proper timeout handling (30 seconds)

### Session API Key Support
- Automatically includes `X-Session-API-Key` header when session_api_key is provided
- Gracefully handles cases where no session key is configured

### Event Buffering
- Events are queued until the configured `event_buffer_size` is reached
- Automatic posting when buffer is full
- Manual posting of remaining events when subscriber is closed

### Retry Logic
- Configurable number of retries (`num_retries`)
- Configurable delay between retries (`retry_delay`)
- Failed events are re-queued for potential future retry

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling with logging
- Graceful degradation when webhook endpoints are unavailable
- Prevents one failing webhook from affecting others

## Configuration

Webhooks are configured through the `WebhookSpec` class with the following parameters:

```python
WebhookSpec(
    webhook_url="https://example.com/webhook",
    event_buffer_size=10,  # Number of events to buffer before posting
    method="POST",         # HTTP method
    headers={"Custom-Header": "value"},  # Additional headers
    num_retries=3,         # Number of retry attempts
    retry_delay=5          # Seconds between retries
)
```

## Usage

The webhook functionality is automatically enabled when webhook specifications are provided in the configuration. Events will be automatically posted to configured webhooks as they occur in conversations.

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Event queuing and automatic posting when buffer is full
- Manual posting of remaining events on close
- Proper inclusion of session API key headers
- Graceful handling when no session key is provided
- HTTP request parameter validation
- JSON serialization of events

All tests pass successfully, confirming the implementation works as expected.
